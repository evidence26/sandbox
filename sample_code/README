Hello & Welcome to the grades calculator!


General
-------
This program gets as an input a csv-format file representing a list of students and their grades in different subjects.
It parses it and prints various statistics

Please note the following:
	The first line of the input file must contain a list of all the subjects (each subject name may be one english word or more)
	All the lines, starting from the second, must begin with the students name, followed by the grades in each subject (numbers only)

	IMPORTANT: Each student must have exactly one grade per subject

For your convenience I've added 2 example input files (the *.csv files)
